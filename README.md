# Some-scripts-in-cancer-analysis
Here are some scripts I used to do quantitative transcriptome analysis. 


BLCA_analysis.R is a script for transcript differential expression analysis using DESeq2 library, it outputs a heatmap based on differentially expressed transcripts.

isoformSwitchAnalysis_RSEM.R is a script for isoform switch analysis using IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR library.

DEXSeqDifferentiallyEpxressedExon.R is a script for exon differential expression analysis using DEXSeq library.
